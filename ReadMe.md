# Qiskit - Beyond Bits 🚀  

**Beyond Bits** is a quantum computing challenge powered by **IBM Quantum** and **Qiskit**. This repository contains the resources you need to dive into the fascinating world of quantum programming.

---

## 🧑‍💻 About the Challenge  

This challenge is inspired by Qiskit's annual quantum challenges and is structured as a series of tasks presented in **Jupyter Notebooks**.  

### What You'll Do:
- Work through **3 Notebooks** of increasing complexity.  
- Use **auto graders** to verify your solutions as you progress.  
- Gain hands-on experience with Qiskit and quantum computing concepts.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure  

- **Notebook 1**: Introduction to Qiskit and the auto grader system.  
- **Notebook 2**: Intermediate-level quantum computing tasks.  
- **Notebook 3**: Advanced problems to test your quantum expertise.  
- **Resources**: Helpful materials and references for learning Qiskit.

## 🛠️ Getting Started  

To get started, set up your environment by following these steps:  

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.7+  
- Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
- Qiskit:  
   ```bash
   pip install qiskit
   ```
- Other:
   ```bash
   pip install qiskit_aer
   pip install qiskit_ibm_runtime
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install pylatexenc
   pip install git+https://github.com/qiskit-community/Quantum-Challenge-Grader.git
   ```

### Check for Dependencies
- Run the following command in your terminal to check for any missing dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip show pylatexenc matplotlib qc_grader
   ```

- Run the following in a Python file:
   ```python
   import qiskit
   qiskit.__version__
   ```

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-name.git
cd Qiskit-BeyondBits
```

### Launch the Notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebooks in sequence and follow the instructions to complete the tasks.
